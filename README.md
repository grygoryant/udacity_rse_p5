# Home Service Robot

The final project of the Udacity Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree.

The goal of this project is to implement home service robot using ROS, that will be able to pick up and drop off the payload in the given locations of the environment.
In order to achieve that, several tasks should be completed:

1. Map the environment using existing environment and ROS SLAM stack;
2. Try to navigate the resulting map using 2D Nav goal;
3. Implement `pick_objects` node to move to the desired pick up and drop off locations;
4. Implement `add_markers` node to vizualize the simulated payload;
5. Connect `pick_objects` and `add_markers` nodes in order to provide full home service robot functionality.
